# Word-location-Tracker---Hashing
Designing a system that lists documents in which a word occurs will be designed. It is very time consuming to look through all the documents at a time to find out which documents a word occurs in. Instead, in this assignment, the words in a newly arrived document will be placed in a dictionary by hashing, and when a word is searched, it will be searched in the dictionary by hashing method and the documents in it will be found.
